EPICS Device
============

This is a lightweight framework for implementing record interfaces for EPICS
IOCs.  This framework is designed to be used in combination with the
epicsdbbuilder library for building the database file, but can be used
standalone.

Simple Example
--------------

For example, to interface to a simple read-write register interface, the
following two fragments of code will serve.  This interface requires one write
PV and one read PV, implemented as follows.

First the interface is implemented and published in C::

    int read_register_value(void) { ... }
    void write_register_value(int value) { ... }

    void publish_pvs(void)
    {
        PUBLISH_READER(longin, "REGISTER", read_register_value);
        PUBLISH_WRITER(longout, "REGISTER", write_register_value);
    }

The corresponding database can be declared (in Python) thus::

    read_reg = longIn('REGISTER', DESC = 'Register readback')
    longOut('REGISTER', DESC = 'Register control', FLNK = read_reg)

With a little more code to tie things together this is a complete example.  For
more details see the example IOCS in the ``examples/`` directory and the
documentation in ``docs/``.


Version 2.0
-----------

Version 2.0 introduces a major incompatibility: the ``mbbi`` and ``mbbo`` record
support no longer uses ``RVAL`` but instead uses ``VAL`` with conversion
disabled.  This means the following changes apply:

* ``TYPEOF(mbbi)`` and ``TYPEOF(mbbo)`` have changed from ``unsigned int`` to
  ``uint16_t``.  This means that all code declaring records of these types will
  need to be changed accordingly.

* The ``mbbIn`` and ``mbbOut`` functions no longer allow the field values to be
  assigned: these are only meaningful for ``RVAL``, which is now ignored.


INSTALLING
==========

This library should be installed as a standard EPICS support package.  This
means that following two files in the ``configure`` directory must be edited:
``configure/RELEASE`` and ``configure/CONFIG_SITE``.

``configure/RELEASE``
    Change the symbol ``EPICS_BASE`` to point to your local installation of
    EPICS.

``configure/CONFIG_SITE``
    This file contains a number of symbols that will need to be customised.

    ``CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS``
        You almost certainly don't want these lines.  Delete them from your
        version unless you know they're needed.

    ``PYTHON``
        This should probably be set to ``python``.

    ``EPICSDBBUILDER``
        The python library `epicsdbbuilder`_ is a prerequisite for building and
        using this library.

        This symbol can be in one of two formats, either an explicit path to the
        directory containing `epicsdbbuilder`_ or a version number understood by
        ``pkg_resources.require``.  Note that if an explicit path is given it is
        not necessary to install or setup ``epicsdbbuilder``, it can be used in
        place.
