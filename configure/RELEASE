# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in the application's top level
# directory.
#
# NOTE: The build does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should run
# "gnumake distclean install" in the top directory each time
# EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external module pointed to
# by this RELEASE file gets rebuilt.
#
# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY contain paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are not module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff.
# Point this to the EPICS installation.
EPICS_BASE = /dls_sw/epics/R3.14.12.7/base
